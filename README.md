# fDSST_Tracking
Fast Discriminative Scale Space Tracking Algorithm

In this project file I used C++ implementation of fDSST(Fast Disriminative Scale Space Tracking) algorithm. 
I updated the main.cpp file to take different type of inputs such as frame, video or webcam.
In this project, the user need to change input data ile paths according to his/her project file path.
